Tasks from my course Spring Data at <a href="www.softuni.bg">SoftUni</a>

<b> Course Curriculum: MySQL </b>

**[DB Apps Introduction](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Spring-Data/tree/main/Lesson01_DBAppsIntroduction):** In this segment of the course, I've delved into the crucial connection between applications and databases. Through a comprehensive exploration, I've learned to establish robust connections, employing JDBC statements to execute SQL queries seamlessly. Understanding SQL injection vulnerabilities has been pivotal, allowing me to develop secure applications. Additionally, I've delved into advanced concepts such as transaction management and database optimization, enhancing my proficiency in database application development.

**[ORM Fundamentals](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Spring-Data/tree/main/Lesson02_ORM_Fundamentals/ORM_Fundamentals)**: This segment of the curriculum has provided a comprehensive understanding of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), elucidating its role in seamlessly integrating object-oriented programming with relational databases. Through exploration of ORM architecture and practical examples, I've gained insight into how ORM frameworks automate database operations, enhance developer productivity, and promote database independence. By studying various ORM approaches and recognizing their advantages, such as code simplification and improved maintainability, I've acquired the proficiency to leverage ORM effectively in database application development, facilitating efficient and scalable software solutions.

**[Introduction to Hibernate](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Spring-Data/tree/main/Lesson03_IntroductionToHibernate)**: In this workshop, I explored the basics of modern Java application development, covering Maven, Hibernate, and the Java Persistence API (JPA). Maven helped me manage my projects smoothly by handling dependencies, while Hibernate simplified my database interactions by automating operations. I also learned about JPA, which provided a standardized way to work with databases, making them independent and scalable. Through practical examples, I gained the skills needed to develop efficient software solutions that connect Java objects with databases.

**[Hibernate Code First](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Spring-Data/tree/main/Lesson04_HibernateCodeFirst)**: During the session, I learned about JPA inheritance strategies, essential for mapping entity data to the database. We discussed the javax.persistence.Inheritance annotation, which offers options like single table per class hierarchy, table per concrete entity class, and the "join" strategy. Additionally, we covered various types of database relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many, and self-referencing relationships. Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing efficient database schemas and optimizing data retrieval operations.

**[Spring Data Intro](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Spring-Data/tree/main/Lesson05_SpringDataIntro)**: Throughout the lesson, I explored the Spring ecosystem, beginning with an introduction to the Spring Platform. This covered various aspects such as Spring Projects, Spring Boot, and the core Spring Framework. As I progressed, I delved into the Spring Data Framework, understanding its significance in simplifying data access and management. I then learned about Spring Data Repositories, which proved invaluable for efficient data interaction. Furthermore, I mastered techniques for Spring Data Query Creation, enhancing my skills in database operations. Finally, I gained insights into Spring Data Services, equipping myself with the knowledge to build robust and scalable Java applications.

**[Spring Data Advanced Querying](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Spring-Data/tree/main/Lesson06_SpringDataAdvancedQuerying)**: During the lecture, we explored the nuances of formulating bespoke queries tailored to specific data requirements. We utilized the Java Persistence Query Language to refine our approach to data retrieval, ensuring precision and efficiency in our querying strategies. Additionally, we examined the advantages of repository inheritance, highlighting its ability to streamline data access across diverse repositories while maintaining coherence and effectiveness. Moreover, insights into Spring's custom configuration capabilities were provided, illustrating their potential to optimize application performance and functionality. Overall, the lecture aimed to equip participants with the expertise needed to adeptly navigate advanced querying techniques within Spring projects.

**[Spring Data Auto Mapping Objects](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Spring-Data/tree/main/Lesson07_SpringDataAutoMappingObjects)**: During my lesson, I immersed myself in the intricacies of Spring Data Auto Mapping Objects, focusing particularly on Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and Model Mapping. I honed my skills in seamlessly transferring data between DTOs and model entities, streamlining the mapping process for enhanced efficiency. This hands-on experience equipped me with the knowledge to optimize data transfer processes and ensure coherence between different layers of the application.

**[JSON Processing](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Spring-Data/tree/main/Lesson08_JSONProcessing)**: In the lecture on JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and its processing, I explored both the fundamentals of JSON and delved into GSON, a robust Java library. This session provided valuable insights into the human-readable format of JSON for transmitting data objects, as well as its support for various data types such as numbers, strings, and arrays. While GSON facilitates seamless conversion between JSON data and Java objects, my focus primarily remained on understanding JSON's role in data interchange. By immersing myself in JSON and gaining a foundational understanding of GSON, I acquired skills essential for effective JSON manipulation in Java environments, thus solidifying my knowledge in data processing techniques.

**[XML Processing](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Spring-Data/tree/main/Lesson09_XMLProcessing)**: During my lesson on XML processing, I immersed myself in a diverse array of techniques aimed at proficiently managing XML data. A pivotal concept introduced was JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding), a framework engineered to streamline the conversion of XML documents into Java objects and back, thereby simplifying the intricate process of parsing and manipulating XML data within Java applications. My exploration of JAXB equipped me with the practical skills needed to seamlessly integrate XML data into Java programs.

In the Spring Data course, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of data access and management. I've learned to simplify database interactions using Spring Data Framework, including repository configuration and custom querying. Additionally, I've explored advanced querying techniques and repository inheritance, enhancing my ability to navigate complex data requirements within Spring projects. This training has equipped me with the expertise to build robust and scalable Java applications with efficient data access layers.
