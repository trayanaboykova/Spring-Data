# Spring-Data
Tasks from my course Spring Data at <a href="www.softuni.bg">SoftUni</a>

<b> Course Curriculum: MySQL </b>

**<ins>DB Apps Introduction</ins>**: In this segment of the course, I've delved into the crucial connection between applications and databases. Through a comprehensive exploration, I've learned to establish robust connections, employing JDBC statements to execute SQL queries seamlessly. Understanding SQL injection vulnerabilities has been pivotal, allowing me to develop secure applications. Additionally, I've delved into advanced concepts such as transaction management and database optimization, enhancing my proficiency in database application development.

**<ins>ORM Fundamentals</ins>**: This segment of the curriculum has provided a comprehensive understanding of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), elucidating its role in seamlessly integrating object-oriented programming with relational databases. Through exploration of ORM architecture and practical examples, I've gained insight into how ORM frameworks automate database operations, enhance developer productivity, and promote database independence. By studying various ORM approaches and recognizing their advantages, such as code simplification and improved maintainability, I've acquired the proficiency to leverage ORM effectively in database application development, facilitating efficient and scalable software solutions.

**<ins>Introduction to Hibernate</ins>**: In this workshop, I explored the basics of modern Java application development, covering Maven, Hibernate, and the Java Persistence API (JPA). Maven helped me manage my projects smoothly by handling dependencies, while Hibernate simplified my database interactions by automating operations. I also learned about JPA, which provided a standardized way to work with databases, making them independent and scalable. Through practical examples, I gained the skills needed to develop efficient software solutions that connect Java objects with databases.

**<ins>Hibernate Code First</ins>**: During the session, I learned about JPA inheritance strategies, essential for mapping entity data to the database. We discussed the javax.persistence.Inheritance annotation, which offers options like single table per class hierarchy, table per concrete entity class, and the "join" strategy. Additionally, we covered various types of database relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many, and self-referencing relationships. Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing efficient database schemas and optimizing data retrieval operations.
